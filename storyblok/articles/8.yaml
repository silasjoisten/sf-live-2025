  # Zero-Downtime Deployment Strategies for Symfony Applications

  ## Keeping Your Application Available During Updates

  Deploying Symfony applications without service interruption requires careful planning and the right infrastructure setup. Zero-downtime deployment ensures that users experience no disruption while you roll out new features, bug fixes, or security updates to your production environment.

  ### Blue-Green Deployment Pattern

  The blue-green deployment strategy has become a standard approach for achieving zero downtime. This technique involves maintaining two identical production environments, with only one active at any given time.

  **Implementation steps:**

  1. **Maintain two environments**: Blue (current production) and Green (staging)
  2. **Deploy to inactive environment**: Push your changes to Green
  3. **Run preparation tasks**:
     ```bash
     # In the Green environment
     php bin/console cache:clear
     php bin/console doctrine:migrations:migrate --no-interaction
     php bin/console cache:warmup
     ```
  4. **Run smoke tests** on Green to verify functionality
  5. **Switch traffic**: Update load balancer to direct traffic to Green
  6. **Monitor**: Watch for any issues with the new deployment
  7. **Rollback if needed**: Switch back to Blue if problems occur

  With Symfony applications, this approach works particularly well because you can prepare the new environment by running migrations, clearing caches, and compiling assets before exposing it to users. Tools like Deployer, Ansible, or platform-specific solutions like AWS Elastic Beanstalk's immutable deployments can help implement this pattern.

  ### Database Migration Strategies

  Database migrations present one of the biggest challenges in zero-downtime deployments. Schema changes must be backward compatible with both the old and new versions of your application during the transition period.
